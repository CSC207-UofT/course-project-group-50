## Task 4 - Scenario Walk-Through

When the program is run, the command line (CmdLineUI) prompts the user to input the numbers of players in the game 
(between 2 to 4 inclusive). Next, it asks the user to enter the usernames of each player. Then the GameController starts
and runs the game. At the beginning of a game, the GameController works with the BoardManager to initialize the players 
(Player objects) and put the players in the starting locations. Once this is set up, a string containing the name, cash,
and netWorth of each player (the respective attributes of the Player objects) is displayed.
