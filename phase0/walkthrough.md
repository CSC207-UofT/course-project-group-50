## Task 4 - Scenario Walk-Through

When the program is run, it asks the user to input the numbers of players in the game (between 2 to 4 inclusive).
Next, it asks the user to enter the usernames of each player.
Then the GameController runs the game.
When the game is running, the GameController works with BoardManager to initialize the players and put the players in the starting locations. Once this is set up, the program outputs an arraylist (in order of turns) containing tuples with the name, cash, and netWorth of the players.
