### 1. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features you can either:
#### (a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to principle or
#### (b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours

##### Principle 1: Equitable Use
- In order to make the design useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities, we selected a colour scheme to optimize visibility and contrast for colour-blind individuals. 
For instance, the palette for the board tiles was taken from a study by Wong (2011) that identified optimal colours for people with both protanopia and deuteranopia, the two most common forms of inherited color blindness.
- We could also allow alternative input sources so that users can enter input by clicking, typing, or speaking into their microphone. For each panel element in the GUI, we could add an alternative text description for users reliant on text-to-speech.

##### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
- To support a wide range of individual preferences and abilities, we could implement a dark mode option in the future. Users would be able to choose between this dark theme and a light theme to accomodate their aesthetic preferences and mitigate unnecessary eye strain.
- We should also allow the user to customize the location of visual elements on the screen, their size, and how many words are associated with each one.
If we continue developing this program and produce a marketable app, we should ensure it’s compatible with Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, IOS, etc. devices.

##### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
- In Phase 1, we only had a command line user interface, which made it difficult for users to keep track of their properties, cash levels, and location on the board. This resulted in an unintuitive user experience and unnecessary complexity. For Phase 2, we focused on developing an easy-to-understand GUI that would be consistent with the user’s intuition. By visually displaying the player’s statistics and the board itself, we were able to improve the playability of our game.
- We also provided effective prompting and feedback during and after each action (such as rolling the dice, moving across the board, and buying properties) via the command line. The wording of these prompts was as clear and understandable as possible.

##### Principle 4: Perceptible Information
- As described prevoiusly, we selected our colour scheme to accommodate colour-blind users and ensure that the design communicates necessary information effectively, regardless of a user’s sensory abilities or ambient conditions.
- In the future, we should consider adding a text-to-speech feature to read out command line prompts for users with vision impairment.

##### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
- Since there are virtually no hazards associated with playing a game of Monopoly,  there were no “adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions” for us to consider. Therefore, this principle doesn’t apply to a program like ours.

##### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
- In the future, our proposed dark mode option will allow users to play our game with minimal fatigue and eye strain.
- Our command line prompts were designed to be a simple and intuitive as possible, to minimize the number of required inputs and avoid sustained, repetitive physical effort.  

##### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
- Since our game has no real-world physical aspect (ie. no controller), this design principle doesn’t directly apply to our project. However, since our current design requires up to four users to interact with a single command-line interface, it’s possible our design doesn’t currently “provide a clear line of sight to important elements” for up to four users crowded around a computer. In the future, we could create a login system allowing users to participate in a multiplayer game from their own devices.
 
### 2. Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.
If we were to sell or license our program, we should market it broadly towards people who like games. In particular, we might be interested in marketing towards fans of the original Monopoly board game who are interested in a computer-based version of this classic game. Since our game is a simplified version of Monopoly, without the complex rules, special conditions, and exceptions of the original game, we could market it towards ameteur Monopoly players and, specifically, users who want to experience the fun of Monopoly without the hassle of overly complicated rules, which can be difficult to grasp.
 
### 3. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to be used by people who do not read braille.
Our program is less likely to be used by older individuals, who are generally less familiar with technology. Therefore, this demographic is less likely to successfully find and download our game. This is unfortunate, since classic Monopoly has been around since the 1930s and it’s likely that this demographic grew up playing the board game and would be enthusiastic about our similar game. To avoid missing out on this demographic entirely, we should consider devoting additional marketing efforts towards older individuals who are more tech-savvy.
