        We could create many board "themes" (ie. UofT board, regular, Halloween),
        each with different "city" names, different arrangement of tiles, etc. */

    /* TODO: In future versions, should edit the entities.Builder pattern to direct different elements of game setup
        Right now, this is primarily a proof of concept.
        More sophisticated methods will be added as we settle on data structs for storing/reading/handling board data
            1. change the interface for entities.City, so that the entities.BoardBuilder manages the colour blocks separately
            2. perhaps expanding to a GameBuilder, managing player setup, token setup, etc */
